# My Hyprland Config files:
I recemtly started daily driving linux, arch in particular. I wanted to try out hyprland and so I sought to backup my config files on github, but anyone who sees something they like can feel free to grab them. At some point, once I understand what I'm doing, and things start looking good, I'll add proper instructions on how to 
replicate the setup. As of now I am using dolphin as my file manager, rofi as an app launcher, kate for note taking, hyprbar, hypridle, hyprlock and hyprpaper. Tips and recommendations would be thoroughly appreciated.
