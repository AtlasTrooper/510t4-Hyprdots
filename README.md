# My Hyprland Config files:
I recemtly started daily driving linux, arch in particular. I wanted to try out hyprland and so I sought to backup my config files/dotfiles on github, but anyone who sees something they like can feel free to grab them. At some point, once I understand what I'm doing, and things start looking good, I'll add proper instructions on how to 
replicate the setup. As of now I am using:

## My Current Setup

### System & Interface
-  **Kitty** → Terminal emulator  
-  **GTK Settings** → Theming for GTK applications
-  **qt6ct** → Theme settings for QT apps
-  **Waybar** → Minimal and customizable status bar  
-  **Theme** → [Juno Palenight]
-  **File Icons** → [Papirus-Dark]
- **Overskride** → for a bluetooth GUI app
- 
  
### File Management
-  **Thunar** → Lightweight file manager  

###  App Launching
-  **Rofi** → Fast application launcher
  
###  Idle, Lock, and Wallpapers
-  **Hypridle** → Idle management  
-  **Hyprlock** → Secure screen locking  
-  **Hyprpaper** → Wallpaper management  (Wallpapers are stored in hypr/wallpapers)

###  Screenshots & Notifications
-  **Hyprshot** → Easy screenshot tool  
-  **notify-send** + **SwayNC** → Clean, modern notifications  

###  Music/ Music Customization
- **Spotify-launcher**
- **Spicetify** → Custom Spotify themes via spotify-launcher
- **Cava** → Audio Visualizer

# Tips and recommendations would be thoroughly appreciated.
