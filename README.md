# My Hyprland Config files:
I recemtly started daily driving linux, arch in particular. I wanted to try out hyprland and so I sought to backup my config files/dotfiles on github, but anyone who sees something they like can feel free to grab them. At some point, once I understand what I'm doing, and things start looking good, I'll add proper instructions on how to 
replicate the setup. As of now I am using:

## 💻 My Current Setup

### 🖥 System & Interface
- 🖥 **Kitty** → Terminal emulator  
- 🎨 **GTK Settings** → Theming for GTK applications
